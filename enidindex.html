			<h3><em>School days</em>
			</h3>
			<br>
			Enid Mary Blyton was born in 1897 and from a young age loved telling stories to her younger brothers, Hanly and Carey. Enid began her schooldays at a small school run by two sisters in a house called Tresco, almost opposite the Blyton home.<br>
			<br>
			Enid's days at Tresco were happy. She was a bright girl, blessed with a good memory, and she shone at art and nature study, though she struggled with mathematics.<br>
			<br>
			In 1907 Enid Blyton became a pupil at St. Christopher's School for Girls in Beckenham. She was not a boarder, like so many of the characters in her books, but a day-girl. Intelligent, popular and full of fun, she threw herself wholeheartedly into school life.<br>
			<br>
			Blyton was a talented pianist, and her parents had hopes that she might play professionally. Instead, Blyton gave up her musical studies to teach. She taught for five years at Bickley, Surbiton, and Chessington, and wrote in her spare time.<br>
			<br>
			Her first book, Child Whispers, a collection of poems, was published in 1922.<br>

			<h3><em>Adulthood</em>
			</h3>
			<br>
			On 28 August 1924 Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without inviting her family. They married shortly after he divorced from his first wife, with whom he had two sons. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes, which became her regular publisher.<br>
			<br>
			In 1942, Blyton and Pollock divorced; the following year, Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters (1892-1967), a London surgeon, with whom she had been friends. They married October 20, 1943, and she subsequently changed the surname of her two daughters to Darrell Waters. Pollock remarried and had little contact with his daughters thereafter. Blyton's second marriage found her happy with her role as a devoted doctor's wife and mother of her two daughters. In 1957, Blyton was diagnosed with a digestive problem;<br>
			<br>
			to keep her from overworking, Blyton's husband led her to believe she was ill from a heart condition. Blyton's husband himself died in 1967. During the following months, she became increasingly ill. Afflicted by Alzheimer's disease, Blyton was moved into a nursing home three months before her death; she died at the Greenways Nursing Home Hampstead, London, on November 28, 1968, aged 71, and was cremated at Golders Green.
